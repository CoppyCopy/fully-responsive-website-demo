# fully-responsive-website-demo

This is my first demo project on web design, which only developed in the frontend. It is fully responsive on any devices, such as iPhones, Androids, PCs, Laptops, etc. It is mostly created for my portfolio. Currently, I am going to make a full stack responsive website (frontend + backend).
